            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Kexin Liu, but you can also call me <strong>Victoria</strong>. I'm from China, and my birthday is on April 17<sup>th</sup>. In fact, coming to study in Canada was a very brave decision for me. I left my family and came to a strange environment. Moreover, my English is not good, which made me feel very panicked. When I first arrived here, I was busy settling down every day. But fortunately, I'm gradually getting used to this kind of life now.</p>
            <h2>Why choose the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> course?</h2>
            <p>In fact, this is my first time to take a media-related course. One of the reasons I chose this course is that I believe the Internet remains an important field for future development. I know that learning a new skill is very challenging for me, but I will make more efforts to overcome this challenge. Just like a sentence I really like <blockquote><em>The only source of knowledge is experience.</em></blockquote> - <cite>Albert Einstein</cite>.</p>
